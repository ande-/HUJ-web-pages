<P>From our constitution: The purpose of Hope United For Justice is to unite students together to engage with social justice issues through education, awareness and action on Hopeâ€™s campus, in the community of Holland and in the global community, while also exploring the interconnectedness of faith and justice. </P>

<P>Approved as a student organization in May of 2010, we are a combination of the previous student groups including Acting on Aids, Amnesty International, Environmental Issues Group, Justice League and Taking Education Abroad (TEA).</P>

<P>The issues of social justice that we are currently exploring are poverty, peace, AIDS, malaria, human trafficking, prisoners of conscience (Amnesty Int'l), environmental and sustainability, child soldiers, and gender and sexuality issues. If you are especially interested in other issues we will be happy to find ways to raise awareness for them.</P>
